# Color Wheel Sorting
Various sorting algorithms demonstrated with a Color Wheel.
Each hue is represented with a number from 0 to 359, which indicate the color of each slice of the wheel.
This list of numbers is shuffled and is sorted, which can be viewed in real time with the color wheel.

Pick between bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, heap sort, merge sort, quick sort, counting sort, radix sort, shell sort, and cocktail shaker sort! Change the number of elements to modify the speed or visibility accordingly.
